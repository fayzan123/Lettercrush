# LetterCrush and Line Manipulation

This repository contains a set of Java programs and unit tests for handling string manipulation and geometric line operations. The main features include:

- **LetterCrush.java**: Implements algorithms for manipulating letter sequences in a puzzle-like format.
- **Line.java**: Provides functionality for creating and testing geometric line properties.
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests in **LetterCrushTest.java** and **LineTest.java** ensure the correctness of the implementations.

## Features
1. LetterCrush: Manipulate and crush letter sequences.
2. Line Geometry: Handle geometric line operations and properties.
3. Unit Testing: Verify the accuracy and reliability of the features through JUnit tests.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Compile the Java files: 
   ```
   javac LetterCrush.java Line.java
   ```
3. Run the unit tests:
   ```
   java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore LetterCrushTest LineTest
   ```
